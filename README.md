# Sort-MTS

Cleans up a particularly nasty xls report from a piece of legacy software. The software runs on an old, non-networked workstation which prevents licensed installation of Office, so the xls binaries were missing from the system. Users were forced to manually convert the report file from xls to csv. The script then cleans, sorts, organizes, and applies headers and footers to a final xlsx document.
